        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Great homemade Italian ravioli recipe that I have recreated to taste like the ravioli at Maggiano's restaurant. 
            Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <h5>Ravioli Dough:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Ravioli Filling:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounch) container ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream </li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Egg Wash:</h5>
        <ul>
             <li>1 egg</li>
             <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water 
             in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other 
             hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and
             wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
        </p>    
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, 
            provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one 
            minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 
            minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.</p>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <p>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.</p>
